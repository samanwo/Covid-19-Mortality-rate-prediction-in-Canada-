# Covid-19-Mortality-rate-prediction-in-Canada-
This notebook utilizes multiple regression models  to predict the number of deaths of individuals with Covid-19 in Canada based on  active cases, number of recoveries, percentage of death, Province, and lockdown phase of each province. Models used include linear regression, naive bayes (bayesian ridge), Random forest regressor,  decision tree regressor, neural network (MLP) regressor and ensemble models. The models were evaluated using the accuracy and cross-validation score. the Ensemble proved to be the most efficient algorithm for predictions with cross validation scores of 88.18% and 85.25% respectively 


Technologies used inlcude: Python, Pandas, Sklearn, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn
